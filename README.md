# Chatbot Graph Builder

A visual **chatbot flow builder** similar to **Dialogflow**, designed to create and manage conversational logic using a graph-based interface.

---

This project allows users to design chatbots by connecting nodes that represent:
- User intents
- Chat responses
- Transitions and conditions
- Dialogue State Tracking

The goal is to make chatbot logic **intuitive, visual, and easy to modify** without hard-coding conversation flows.
